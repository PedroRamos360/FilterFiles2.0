# FilterFiles2.0
FilterFiles is a simple console program that goes trough all files in a location that is choosen by the user and filter them in folders based on 
the type of each file. It is ideal for organizing a downloads folder and this was my main goal when building this application, although it can also
be used for any folder that you would like. 

The reason of 2.0 in the name is because this is a new version of a script I built some time ago, this time
it is more efficient and has new features, the main differences are:
- Has personalizable folder directory
- Executes only once, instead of keep looking for changes in the folder in the background (which I decided that was unecessary use of RAM)
- Change on variable names to make it more clear
- The folders where the files are put on don't need to be pre-created, the program does it automatically
